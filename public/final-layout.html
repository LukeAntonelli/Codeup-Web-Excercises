  			<span class="component">Yakitori Sauce</span>
					<li>2 cups tamari (not regular soy sauce)</li>
					<li>2 cups mirin</li>  
					<li>2 ounces fresh ginger, peeled and sliced about 1/2-inch thick, or more to taste</li>
					<li>1 bunch green onions (green part only)</li>
					<li>1 cup dark-brown sugar</li>

		<p class="instructions">

			<span class="component">Chicken</span>
			<li>1 whole chicken (or boneless, skinless breasts or thighs)</li>
			<li>Bamboo skewers 8 inches or longer</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="instructions">
		Preheat grill. Cut chicken into pieces about 1 1/2 inches by 1 1/2 inches. (Sakurai also likes to use the liver, gizzard, and heart.) Thread on skewers and grill, turning, just until surface of meat lightens, about 2 1/2 minutes. Brush chicken with Yakitori Sauce on all sides and cook until done, another 2 1/2 to 3 minutes, applying sauce a couple more times. Do not let flames touch chicken. Meat is done when firm to the touch but not hard.</p>

  		</span>
  		<ul class="recipe">
  		<li>6 to 8 slices of dense rustic bread, 1 inch thick or more (stale bread works well)</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus some for brushing and tossing</li>
		<li>8 large tomatoes (enough to make about 2 cups of  juice and pulp)</li>
		<li>1 clove garlic, finely grated </li>
		<li>1 large zucchini cut lengthwise into 1/8 -inch-thick slices  (skin on)</li>
		<li>1 fennel bulb cut crosswise into 1/8 -inch-thick slices</li>
		<li>1 cup fennel fronds (reserve a few for garnish)</li>
		<li>1 cup dill fronds (reserve a few)</li>
		<li>1 cup Italian parsley (reserve a few leaves)</li>
		<li>1 cup basil (reserve a few)</li>
		<li>1/2 medium red onion, thinly sliced</li>
		<li>1 pint stracciatella, burrata, or other rich, mild cheese, at room temperature</li>
		<li>kosher or sea salt to taste </li>
		</ul>

		<p class="instructions">
			Preheat grill (can use a toaster or panini press). Brush bread with olive oil and grill until a deep golden-brown on both sides. Grate tomatoes using the large holes on a box grater and put juice and pulp in a nonreactive bowl or pan. Stir in garlic, 2 tablespoons olive oil, and salt. Briefly soak bread until it is thoroughly moist but not soggy. Meanwhile, in a separate bowl, toss sliced zucchini, fennel, herbs, and onion with olive oil and salt. Set aside. Spread bread generously with stracciatella and arrange zucchini mixture attractively on top. Serve on a platter garnished with reserved herbs.
