	<h1>Jabberwocky</h1>
	<h3><span id="not-george">BY GEORGE HASKELL</span>BY LEWIS CARROLL</h3>
	<p class="left">
	'Twas <em>brilling</em>, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.
	</p>
	<p id="right">
		"<strong>Beware the Jabberwock</strong>, my son!
		The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
		Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
		The frumious Bandersnatch!"
	</div>
	<p class="left">
		He took his vorpal sword in hand;
Long time the manxome foe he sought&mdash;
So rested he by the Tumtum tree
And stood awhile in thought.
