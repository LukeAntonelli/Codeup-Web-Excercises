	<h3><span id="not-george">BY GEORGE HASKELL</span>BY LEWIS CARROLL</h3>
	<p id="para1">
	'Twas <em>brilling</em>, and the slithy toves</br>
	Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br>
	All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
	And the mome raths outgrabe.
	</p>

	<p id="para2">
		"<span id="beware">Beware the Jabberwock</span>, my son!<br>
		The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br>
		Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br>
		The frumious Bandersnatch!"
	</p>

	<p id="para3">
		He took his vorpal sword in hand;<br>
		Long time the manxome foe he sought-<br>
		So rested he by the Tumtum tree<br>
		And stood awhile in thought.
